# Voron-Trident-5mm-Extrusion
modified all printed parts so they can be used with 5mm T-Slot extrusions



---
living in Germany makes the "Voron" standard 6mm T-Slot extrusion hard to get.

So building a Voron is not that straight forward.

The 5mm T-Slot extrusions on the other hand are just two clicks away.

So i decided to modify all printed parts for a Voron Trident to work with 5mm T-Slot extrusions.


Were i bought the extrusions:
